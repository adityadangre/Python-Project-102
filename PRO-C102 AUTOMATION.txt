    Ans : pip install pyttsx3 (Python text to speech version 3)
          import pyttsx3

    2. Python module for extracting text from pdf file
    Ans: pip install PyPDF2
         import PyPDF2

    3. Python code
    Ans: 1. Open your pdf file, either give direct path or take input from user
         2. Read pdf file with PyPDF2.Pdf FileReader
         3. Then, intialize speaker with speaker = pyttsx3.init()
         4. Extract page from pdf file which we want to read with getPage()
         5. Extract text from that page for reading with extractText()
         6. Give the page to speaker for reading with speaker.say(text)
         7. Give command to speaker for run & wait speaker.runAndWait()


Problem 2 can be solved by building screen recorder  
    1. Python module to grab image
    Ans: pip install pillow 
         from PIL import ImageGrab

    2. Python module for working with array
    Ans: pip install numpy
         import numpy as np

    3. Python module use to capture image & display 
    Ans: pip install opencv-contrib-python
         import cv2

    4. Python module to import system Metrics
    Ans: pip install pywin32
         from win32api import GetSystemMetrics

    5. Python module to create special file name 
    Ans: import datetime

    6. Python code


Problem 3 can be solved by building my own security camera
    1. Package to detect computer vision
    Ans: import cv2

    2. Python module to make movement sensor
    Ans: import winsound

    3. Python code
        1. Open webcam and show video on screen
        2. Detect any movement like any person come in your room
        3. If any movement detected then play buzzer
        4. Now let's start to do python code
